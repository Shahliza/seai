# Individual Assignment 1: ML-Product

(17-445/17-645/17-745 Machine Learning in Production)

## Overview

Building a system with an AI component requires more than building and tuning a model. The AI component is typically just a part of a larger system. In this assignment you will build a simple product using an ML model.

Learning goals:
* Demonstrate familiarity with programming skills necessary for this course
* Understand the scope of software engineering challenges when building an production system with ML components
* Identify technical and nontechnical challenges 

## Tasks

## Deliverables

Commit your implementation to your GitHub repository. On the GitHub webpage, click on the last commit message and copy the URL in the format `https://github.com/[user]/[repo]/commit/[commitid]`. Make sure that the link includes the long ID of the last commit.

Submit a PDF document that contains the Github link to your last command and a brief answer to our questions. Submit this PDF document document to Gradescope by [see Canvas]. 


## Grading

**Important:** Please read the grading specifications carefully. Note from the syllabus that we grade each requirement below pass/fail. That is, there is no partial credit when not fully meeting all parts of the specification and no extra credit for going beyond the specification. For example, if the document is clearly structured but you do not map questions to the relevant pages in Gradescope, you will lose the full 10 points for the first requirement. You can make up for lost points by resubmitting the assignment later, using some of your tokens, as described in the syllabus. The grading specifications should be clear enough that you should be able to evaluate yourself with high confidence whether your solution meets the specification.

In this, as in all future assignments, we are happy to answer clarification questions about criteria in the rubric. If you are not sure what is expected of you, please ask.

The assignment is worth 100 points. We will assign credit as follows:

* 10p: The document is clearly structured, such that it is clear which text belongs to which question. The document includes a link to a specific commit in your GitHub repository. When uploading the solution to Gradescope, questions are mapped to the relevant pages (see “Assign” in the [Gradescope documentation](https://gradescope-static-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/help/submitting_hw_guide.pdf)).
